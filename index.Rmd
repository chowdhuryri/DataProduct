## Paired Count Data

. Correlated count data are generated from various fields. For example,

- Number of accidents and fatalities
- Number of episodes of depression and number of visits to doctors
- Number of sales of different products

. Leiter and Hamadan (1973) suggested following bivariate probability
models.
$$g(y_1,y_2)=\frac{e^{-\lambda_1}\lambda_1^{y_1} e^{-\lambda_2 y_1}{(\lambda_2 y_1)}^{y_2}}{y_1! y_2!},\mbox{ } y_1 =0,1,...;\mbox{ } y_2=0,1,...;\mbox{ }\lambda_1, \mbox{ }\lambda_2 > 0.$$

. Observed data may not cover the full range as the
theoretical range above.

. This produces right truncation for both the variables.

. Therefore, the total probability may not sum to one.

## Total Probability Calculation from simulated data
. Following r code chunk calculate total probability using bivariate pdf.

. In following code Y1 and Y2 values are 0 to 14 and lambda1 = 0.76
and lambda2 = 3.5.

```{r,echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
library(slidifyLibraries)

mypdf<-function(y1,y2,l1,l2){
mymat<-matrix(0,y1+1,y2+1)
  for (i in 0:y1){
     for (j in 0:y2){mymat[i,j]<-(exp(-l1)*l1^i/factorial(i)) * (exp(-l2*i)*(l2*i)^j/factorial(j))
            }
  }
mymat
}
```

## Codes
```{r,echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
#y1 <-14;y2 <-14;l1 <-.76;l2<-3.5
y11<-5;y21 <-5;l11 <-2.06;l21<-1.19
y12<-9;y22 <-7;l12 <-3.94;l22<-.96
y13<-15;y23<-15;l13<-3.94;l23<-.96
```
. Total probability for different combinations of Y1, Y2, lambda1 and
lambda2 values.

```{r,echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, results='asis'}
cat("Y1 = ",y11,",","Y2 = ",y21,",","l1 = ",l11,",","l2 = ",l21,",","Total Prob. = ", sum(mypdf(y11,y21,l11,l21)),"\n")

cat("Y1 = ",y12,",","Y2 = ",y22,",","l1 = ",l12,",","l2 = ",l22,",","Total Prob. = ", sum(mypdf(y12,y22,l12,l22)),"\n")

cat("Y1 = ",y13,",","Y2 = ",y23,",","l1 = ",l13,",","l2 = ",l23,",","Total Prob. = ", sum(mypdf(y13,y23,l13,l23)),"\n")
```

## Conclusions

**Conclusions:**

- Right truncation should be considered in analyzing count data.
- Adapting right truncated models would provide more refined estimates.
